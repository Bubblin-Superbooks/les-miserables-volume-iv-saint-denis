Jean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter&rsquo;s lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two straw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise in one corner, and never any fire. He dined with Cosette, and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use.</p><p>When Toussaint came, he had said to her: &ldquo;It is the young lady who is the mistress of this house.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And you, monsieur?&rdquo; Toussaint replied in amazement.&mdash;&ldquo;I am a much better thing than the master, I am the father.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
