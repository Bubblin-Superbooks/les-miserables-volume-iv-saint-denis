<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Laigle de Meaux, as the reader knows, lived more with Joly than elsewhere. He had a lodging, as a bird has one on a branch. The two friends lived together, ate together, slept together. They had everything in common, even Musichetta, to some extent. They were, what the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called, bini. On the morning of the 5th of June, they went to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly, who was all stuffed up, had a catarrh which Laigle was beginning to share. Laigle&rsquo;s coat was threadbare, but Joly was well dressed.</p><p>It was about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when they opened the door of Corinthe.</p><p>They ascended to the first floor.</p></div> </div>
