He wore a scarlet waistcoat, and indulged in the sort of words which break everything. His waistcoat astounded a passer-by, who cried in bewilderment:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here are the reds!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The reds, the reds!&rdquo; retorted Bahorel. &ldquo;A queer kind of fear, bourgeois. For my part I don&rsquo;t tremble before a poppy, the little red hat inspires me with no alarm. Take my advice, bourgeois, let&rsquo;s leave fear of the red to horned cattle.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
