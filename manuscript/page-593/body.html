Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderot at their head; the physiocrates, Turgot at their head; the philosophers, Voltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at their head,&mdash;these are four sacred legions. Humanity&rsquo;s immense advance towards the light is due to them. They are the four vanguards of the human race, marching towards the four cardinal points of progress.</p></div> </div>
