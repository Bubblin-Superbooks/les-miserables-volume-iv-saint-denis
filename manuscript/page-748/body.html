<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the house with very little hope, and quitted it with immense despair.</p><p>However, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will understand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin Th√©odule, had left no trace in his mind. Not the slightest. The dramatic poet might, apparently, expect some complications from this revelation made point-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what the drama would gain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one believes nothing in the line of evil; later on comes the age when one believes everything. Suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles. Early youth has none of them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous over Candide. Suspect Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius could sooner have committed.</p></div> </div>
