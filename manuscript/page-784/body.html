<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Any other sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a revolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. These pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against Louis XIV. is insurrection; HÃ©bert against Danton is revolt.</p><p>Hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, as Lafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be the most fatal of crimes.</p><p>There is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection is often a volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw.</p></div> </div>
