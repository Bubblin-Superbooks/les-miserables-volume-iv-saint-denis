<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Do you know what is done then? One does not take the matter ferociously; one does not precipitate himself into the tragic; one does not make one&rsquo;s mind to marriage and M. le Maire with his scarf. One simply behaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along, mortals; don&rsquo;t marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is a good-natured fellow at bottom, and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; you say to him: â€˜See here, grandfather.&rsquo; And the grandfather says: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself, and old age must wear out. I have been young, you will be old. Come, my boy, you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles. Amuse yourself, deuce take it!&rsquo; Nothing better! That&rsquo;s the way the affair should be treated. You don&rsquo;t marry, but that does no harm. You understand me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
