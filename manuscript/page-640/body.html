<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jean Valjean suspected nothing.</p><p>Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that sufficed for Jean Valjean&rsquo;s happiness. The thoughts which Cosette cherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius&rsquo; image which filled her heart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful, chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ease. And then, when two lovers have come to an understanding, things always go well; the third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the same in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of Jean Valjean&rsquo;s proposals. Did she want to take a walk? &ldquo;Yes, dear little father.&rdquo; Did she want to stay at home? Very good.</p></div> </div>
