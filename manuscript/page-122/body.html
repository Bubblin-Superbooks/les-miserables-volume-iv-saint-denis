I have read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my constitution of the year Two by heart. &lsquo;The liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins.&rsquo; Do you take me for a brute? I have an old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The Rights of Man, the sovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a HÃ©bertist. I can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch in hand.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
