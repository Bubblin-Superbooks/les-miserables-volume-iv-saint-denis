I shall never put on those horrors again. With that machine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>From that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had always heretofore asked to remain at home, saying: &ldquo;Father, I enjoy myself more here with you,&rdquo; now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them?</p><p>He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who was shy, never set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a dog.</p></div> </div>
