<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn&rsquo;t a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays? It&rsquo;s you who ought not to be here. What have you come here for, since it&rsquo;s a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There&rsquo;s nothing to be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It&rsquo;s a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen you! So you&rsquo;re out?&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier tried to disentangle himself from Éponine&rsquo;s arms, and grumbled:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. You&rsquo;ve embraced me. Yes, I&rsquo;m out. I&rsquo;m not in. Now, get away with you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
