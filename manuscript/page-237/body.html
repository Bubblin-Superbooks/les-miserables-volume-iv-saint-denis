Jean Valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his little lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room hung with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjean sometimes said to her, smiling at his happiness in being importuned: &ldquo;Do go to your own quarters! Leave me alone a little!&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father.</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don&rsquo;t you have a carpet here and a stove?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
