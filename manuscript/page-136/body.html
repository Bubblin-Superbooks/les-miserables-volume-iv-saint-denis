He had learned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the courts, that Thénardier was in close confinement. Every Monday, Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk&rsquo;s office of La Force for Thénardier.</p><p>As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from Courfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money. These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac who lent and to Thénardier who received them. &ldquo;To whom can they go?&rdquo; thought Courfeyrac. &ldquo;Whence can this come to me?&rdquo; Thénardier asked himself.</p></div> </div>
