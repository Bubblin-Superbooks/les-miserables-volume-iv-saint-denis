<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of Parisians calls &ldquo;the epoch of the riots,&rdquo; is certainly a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century. A last word, before we enter on the recital.</p><p>The facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space. There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation, human tremor. Petty details, as we think we have already said, are, so to speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance of history. The epoch, surnamed &ldquo;of the riots,&rdquo; abounds in details of this nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps have not sounded the depths, for another reason than history.</p></div> </div>
