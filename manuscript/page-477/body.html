This grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries. Gavroche&rsquo;s bed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The whole resembled an Esquimaux tent.</p><p>This trellis-work took the place of curtains.</p><p>Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front, and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart.</p><p>&ldquo;Down on all fours, brats!&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he crawled in after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the opening hermetically again.</p></div> </div>
