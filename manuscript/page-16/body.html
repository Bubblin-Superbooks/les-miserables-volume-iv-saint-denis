<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We shall make the attempt.</p><p>The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to define, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place.</p><p>These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but repose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition, to be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great events, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we have seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would exchange CÃ¦sar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. &ldquo;What a good little king was he!&rdquo; We have marched since daybreak, we have reached the evening of a long and toilsome day;</p></div> </div>
