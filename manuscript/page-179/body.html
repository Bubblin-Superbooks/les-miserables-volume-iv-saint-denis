<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Some days after this visit of a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; to Farmer Mabeuf, one morning,&mdash;it was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece from Courfeyrac for Th√©nardier&mdash;Marius had put this coin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerk&rsquo;s office, he had gone &ldquo;to take a little stroll,&rdquo; in the hope that this would make him work on his return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he rose, he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation; his task at that epoch consisted in turning into French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savigny controversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried to write one, could not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rose from his chair, saying: &ldquo;I shall go out. That will put me in spirits.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
