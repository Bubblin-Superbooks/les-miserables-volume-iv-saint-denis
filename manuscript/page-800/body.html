<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade, who asked him: &ldquo;Whither are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;Eh! well, I have no weapons.&rdquo; &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to my timber-yard to get my compasses.&rdquo; &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an expeditious man, accosted some passing artisans: &ldquo;Come here, you!&rdquo; He treated them to ten sous&rsquo; worth of wine and said: &ldquo;Have you work?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go to Filspierre, between the Barrière Charonne and the Barrière Montreuil, and you will find work.&rdquo; At Filspierre&rsquo;s they found cartridges and arms. Certain well-known leaders were going the rounds, that is to say, running from one house to another, to collect their men.</p></div> </div>
