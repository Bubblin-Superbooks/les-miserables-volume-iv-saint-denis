<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were &ldquo;assemblages&rdquo;, motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst of running water.</p><p>At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked. It formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones. There were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks, blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a dull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of the throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the extension of the Rue Saint-Honor√©, there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning.</p></div> </div>
