<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ye who suffer because ye love, love yet more. To die of love, is to live in it.</p><p>Love. A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture. There is ecstasy in agony.</p><p>Oh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing.</p><p>Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.</p><p>Deep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a long trial, an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. This destiny, the true one, begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb. Then something appears to him, and he begins to distinguish the definitive. The definitive, meditate upon that word. The living perceive the infinite; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead. In the meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate.</p></div> </div>
