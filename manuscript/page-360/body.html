In order to get rid of her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, and had begun to sing, accompanying herself the while, the chorus from Euryanthe: &ldquo;Hunters astray in the wood!&rdquo; which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained wrapped in thought.</p><p>All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden.</p><p>It could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint, she was in bed, and it was ten o&rsquo;clock at night.</p><p>She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, and laid her ear against it.</p></div> </div>
