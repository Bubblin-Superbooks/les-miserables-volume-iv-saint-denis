This package was taken to the police station. It was opened, and in it were found two printed dialogues, signed Lahautière, a song entitled: &ldquo;Workmen, band together,&rdquo; and a tin box full of cartridges.</p><p>One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how warm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.</p><p>In a ditch on the boulevard, between Père-Lachaise and the Barrière du Trône, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing, discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood, a bag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of hunting-powder, and a little cast-iron pot whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead.</p></div> </div>
