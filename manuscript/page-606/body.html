This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is walking and advancing. It seems a victor; this dead body is a conqueror. He arrives with his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism, with his banner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles. He advances, he threatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us not despair, on our side. Let us sell the field on which Hannibal is encamped.</p><p>What have we to fear, we who believe?</p><p>No such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there exists a return of a river on its course.</p></div> </div>
