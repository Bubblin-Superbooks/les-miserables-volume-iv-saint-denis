<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At Barthélemy&rsquo;s, near the Barrière du Trône, at Capel&rsquo;s, near the Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air. They were heard to say: &ldquo;Have you your pistol?&rdquo; &ldquo;Under my blouse.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Under my shirt.&rdquo; In the Rue Traversière, in front of the Bland workshop, and in the yard of the Maison-Brulée, in front of tool-maker Bernier&rsquo;s, groups whispered together. Among them was observed a certain Mavot, who never remained more than a week in one shop, as the masters always discharged him &ldquo;because they were obliged to dispute with him every day.&rdquo; Mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of the Rue Ménilmontant. Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the struggle, seconded Mavot, and to the question: &ldquo;What is your object?&rdquo; he replied: &ldquo;Insurrection.</p></div> </div>
