<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thought is the toil of the intelligence, reverie its voluptuousness. To replace thought with reverie is to confound a poison with a food.</p><p>Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chim√¶ras without object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one&rsquo;s self except for the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and stagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase. This is a law. Man, in a state of reverie, is generally prodigal and slack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.</p><p>There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor man who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. Resources are exhausted, needs crop up.</p></div> </div>
