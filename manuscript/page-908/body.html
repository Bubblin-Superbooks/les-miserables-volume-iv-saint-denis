It has acquired all my folds, it does not bind me anywhere, it is moulded on my deformities, it falls in with all my movements, I am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm. Old coats are just like old friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue, &ldquo;an old goat is an old abi&rdquo; (ami, friend).</p></div> </div>
