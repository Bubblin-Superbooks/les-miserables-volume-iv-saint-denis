The two children, somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without uttering a word, and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags which had given them bread and had promised them a shelter.</p><p>There, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it with remarkable vigor, and placed it against one of the elephant&rsquo;s forelegs. Near the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished.</p></div> </div>
