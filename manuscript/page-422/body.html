<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A cobbler opposite called them to him, and delivered to them a paper which &ldquo;their mother&rdquo; had left for them. On this paper there was an address: M. Barge, collector of rents, Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, No. 8. The proprietor of the stall said to them: &ldquo;You cannot live here any longer. Go there. It is nearby. The first street on the left. Ask your way from this paper.&rdquo;</p><p>The children set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in his hand the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbed little fingers could not close very firmly, and they did not keep a very good hold on the paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust of wind tore it from him, and as night was falling, the child was not able to find it again.</p></div> </div>
