I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad I shall be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to try something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here, so that you may be successful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish it. You are my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing that music from Euryanthe that you love, and that you came one evening to listen to, outside my shutters. But day after to-morrow you will come early. I shall expect you at dusk, at nine o&rsquo;clock precisely, I warn you. Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the days are so long! On the stroke of nine, do you understand, I shall be in the garden.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
