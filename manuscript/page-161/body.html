A gate on a garden.&rdquo;</p><p>This is what Brujon had written the night before.</p><p>In spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note on from La Force to the Salpêtrière, to a &ldquo;good friend&rdquo; whom he had and who was shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly suspected by the police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose name the reader has already seen, had relations with the Thénardier, which will be described in detail later on, and she could, by going to see Éponine, serve as a bridge between the Salpêtrière and Les Madelonettes.</p></div> </div>
