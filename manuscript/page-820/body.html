<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Geneviève; one in the Rue Ménilmontant, where was visible a porte-cochère torn from its hinges; another near the little bridge of the Hôtel-Dieu made with an &ldquo;écossais,&rdquo; which had been unharnessed and overthrown, three hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police.</p><p>At the barricade of the Rue des Ménétriers, a well-dressed man distributed money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat, a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is to pay expenses, wine, et cætera.&rdquo; A light-haired young man, without a cravat, went from barricade to barricade, carrying pass-words.</p></div> </div>
