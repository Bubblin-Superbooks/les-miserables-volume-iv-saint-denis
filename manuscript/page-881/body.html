Near the Rue des Billettes, a man of lofty stature, whose hair was turning gray, and whose bold and daring mien was remarked by Courfeyrac, Enjolras, and Combeferre, but whom none of them knew, joined them. Gavroche, who was occupied in singing, whistling, humming, running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol; paid no attention to this man.</p><p>It chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed in front of Courfeyrac&rsquo;s door.</p><p>&ldquo;This happens just right,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac, &ldquo;I have forgotten my purse, and I have lost my hat.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
