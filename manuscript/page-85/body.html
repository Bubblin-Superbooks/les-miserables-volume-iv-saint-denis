They never stayed more than ten minutes. Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone: &ldquo;The plot is ripe, the matter is arranged.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was murmured by all who were there,&rdquo; to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present. The exaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop: &ldquo;We have no arms!&rdquo; One of his comrades replied: &ldquo;The soldiers have!&rdquo; thus parodying without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte&rsquo;s proclamation to the army in Italy: &ldquo;When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand,&rdquo; adds one report, &ldquo;they did not communicate it to each other.&rdquo; It is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said.</p></div> </div>
