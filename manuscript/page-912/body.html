<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel, the symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, the apple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, and the fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know what right is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, and demands what wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: &lsquo;The wrong that Alba did to you, the wrong that Fidenæ did to you, the wrong that the Eques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They were your neighbors. The Clusians are ours. We understand neighborliness just as you do. You have stolen Alba, we shall take Clusium.&rsquo; Rome said: &lsquo;You shall not take Clusium.&rsquo; Brennus took Rome. Then he cried: &lsquo;Væ victis!&rsquo; That is what right is. Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world! What eagles! It makes my flesh creep.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
