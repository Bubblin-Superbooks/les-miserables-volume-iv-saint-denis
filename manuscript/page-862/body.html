Her ears were very wide apart, her saddle deep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly articulated knees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper. A little more than fifteen hands in height.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A pretty horse,&rdquo; remarked the hair-dresser.</p><p>&ldquo;It was His Majesty&rsquo;s beast.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
