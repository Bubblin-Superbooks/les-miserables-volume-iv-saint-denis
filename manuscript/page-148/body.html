<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It chanced that Marius&rsquo; solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground, near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard, a passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place, asked this passer-by:&mdash;&ldquo;What is the name of this spot?&rdquo;</p><p>The person replied: &ldquo;It is the Lark&rsquo;s meadow.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added: &ldquo;It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry.&rdquo;</p><p>But after the word &ldquo;Lark&rdquo; Marius heard nothing more. These sudden congealments in the state of reverie, which a single word suffices to evoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea, and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.</p></div> </div>
