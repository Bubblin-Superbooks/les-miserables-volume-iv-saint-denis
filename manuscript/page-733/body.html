<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Between ourselves, I think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit. I don&rsquo;t know where he did it. However, that&rsquo;s not to the purpose. Besides, he is not to be believed. He brags, Marius! I think it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love. It&rsquo;s the right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as a Jacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, sapristi! with twenty petticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I will do myself the justice to say, that in the line of sans-culottes, I have never loved any one but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce! There&rsquo;s no objection to that. As for the little one, she receives you without her father&rsquo;s knowledge. That&rsquo;s in the established order of things. I have had adventures of that same sort myself. More than one.</p></div> </div>
