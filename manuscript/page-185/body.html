<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Do you know, Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don&rsquo;t know what. It isn&rsquo;t true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, they go to the Luxembourg, in front of the ch√¢teau, where there is the most sun, and they read the Quotidienne for a sou. I once carried a letter to a baron of that sort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where do you live now?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius made no reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it up for you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
