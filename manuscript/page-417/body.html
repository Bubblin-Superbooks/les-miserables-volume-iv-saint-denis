Magnon needed two children; the Thénardiers had two. The same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a good investment for the other. The little Thénardiers became little Magnons. Magnon quitted the Quai des Célestins and went to live in the Rue Clocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken between one street and another.</p><p>The registry office being in no way warned, raised no objections, and the substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world.

Gillenormand continued to perform his compact.</p></div> </div>
