<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you.&rdquo;</p><p>Mother Hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account. She was satisfied after the manner of that Arab woman, who, having received a box on the ear from her husband, went to complain to her father, and cried for vengeance, saying: &ldquo;Father, you owe my husband affront for affront.&rdquo; The father asked: &ldquo;On which cheek did you receive the blow?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the left cheek.&rdquo; The father slapped her right cheek and said: &ldquo;Now you are satisfied. Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter&rsquo;s ears, and that I have accordingly boxed his wife&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
