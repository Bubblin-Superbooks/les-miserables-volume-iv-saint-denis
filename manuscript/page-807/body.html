<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At the Bastille, long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the procession, and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng.</p><p>One man was heard to say to another: &ldquo;Do you see that fellow with a red beard, he&rsquo;s the one who will give the word when we are to fire.&rdquo; It appears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Qu√©nisset affair, entrusted with this same function.</p><p>The hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reached the esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd, surveyed at that moment with a bird&rsquo;s-eye view, would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread out over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin.</p></div> </div>
