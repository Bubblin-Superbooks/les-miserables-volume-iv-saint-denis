Mabeuf was descending on his side.</p><p>The Flora of Cauteretz no longer sold at all. The experiments on indigo had not been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, which had a bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness. Nevertheless, he did not become discouraged. He had obtained a corner in the Jardin des Plantes, with a good exposure, to make his trials with indigo &ldquo;at his own expense.&rdquo; For this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the Flora.</p></div> </div>
