<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in one&rsquo;s hand in the open street, is so much of a public function that Gavroche felt his fervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the Marseillaise which he was singing, he shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I&rsquo;m all broken up with rheumatism, but I&rsquo;m satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeois have to do is to bear themselves well, I&rsquo;ll sneeze them out subversive couplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I&rsquo;d just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol. I&rsquo;m just from the boulevard, my friends. It&rsquo;s getting hot there, it&rsquo;s getting into a little boil, it&rsquo;s simmering. It&rsquo;s time to skim the pot.</p></div> </div>
