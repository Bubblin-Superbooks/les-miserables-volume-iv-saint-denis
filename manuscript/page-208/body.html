Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:&mdash;Ultime Fauchelevent.</p><p>At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the slightest disquietude which should assail him, and in short, so that he might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculously escaped from Javert. These two apartments were very pitiable, poor in appearance, and in two quarters which were far remote from each other, the one in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest, the other in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Arm√©.</p></div> </div>
