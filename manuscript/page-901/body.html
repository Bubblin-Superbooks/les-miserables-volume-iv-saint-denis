<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The hall on the first floor, where &ldquo;the restaurant&rdquo; was situated, was a large and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, and tables, and with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reached by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the hatchway of a ship.</p><p>This room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that was always burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniture comported itself as though it had but three legs&mdash;the whitewashed walls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of Mame Hucheloup:&mdash;</p><p>Elle étonne à dix pas, elle épouvente à deux, Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux; On tremble à chaque instant qu&rsquo;elle ne vous la mouche Et qu&rsquo;un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.</p></div> </div>
