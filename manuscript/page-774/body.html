<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It might have been said: &lsquo;Ah! this is broken.&rsquo; After the Revolution of July, one was sensible only of deliverance; after the riots, one was conscious of a catastrophe.</p><p>&ldquo;All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the Exchange into consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, precipitates failures; no more money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, public credit shaken, industry disconcerted, capital withdrawing, work at a discount, fear everywhere; counter-shocks in every town. Hence gulfs. It has been calculated that the first day of a riot costs France twenty millions, the second day forty, the third sixty, a three days&rsquo; uprising costs one hundred and twenty millions, that is to say, if only the financial result be taken into consideration, it is equivalent to a disaster, a shipwreck or a lost battle, which should annihilate a fleet of sixty ships of the line.</p></div> </div>
