<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags; and the &ldquo;Thou shalt be King&rdquo; could be quite as mournfully hurled at Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr. The croak would be almost identical.</p><p>The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their own concerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a rag-picker with her basket on her back.</p><p>All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age, which are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness.</p><p>The rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the rag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes. This is caused by the corner for refuse, which is fat or lean, according to the will of the portresses, and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap. There may be kindness in the broom.</p></div> </div>
