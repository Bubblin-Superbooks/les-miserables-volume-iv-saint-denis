I tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marius&rsquo; love affairs!&rdquo; exclaimed Grantaire. &ldquo;I can imagine it. Marius is a fog, and he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race of poets. He who says poet, says fool, madman, Tymbr√¶us Apollo. Marius and his Marie, or his Marion, or his Maria, or his Mariette. They must make a queer pair of lovers. I know just what it is like. Ecstasies in which they forget to kiss. Pure on earth, but joined in heaven. They are souls possessed of senses. They lie among the stars.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
