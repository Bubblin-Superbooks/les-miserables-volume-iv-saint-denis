I&rsquo;m not the daughter of a dog, since I&rsquo;m the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, what matters that to me? You are men. Well, I&rsquo;m a woman. You don&rsquo;t frighten me. I tell you that you shan&rsquo;t enter this house, because it doesn&rsquo;t suit me. If you approach, I&rsquo;ll bark. I told you, I&rsquo;m the dog, and I don&rsquo;t care a straw for you. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you please, but don&rsquo;t come here, I forbid it! You can use your knives. I&rsquo;ll use kicks; it&rsquo;s all the same to me, come on!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
