<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. It is the same in things pertaining purely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, clear-sighted to-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same fury legitimate when directed against Terray and absurd when directed against Turgot. The destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking of rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of multitudes, the refusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated by students, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and stoned,&mdash;that is revolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against Cicero,&mdash;that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,&mdash;that is insurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against Christopher Columbus,&mdash;this is the same revolt; impious revolt;</p></div> </div>
