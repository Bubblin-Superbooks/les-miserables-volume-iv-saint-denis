They are an enthusiastic family, but liable to cool off. I don&rsquo;t know what has been the matter with them for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They are becoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, but with firmness. They meet at Richefeu&rsquo;s. They are to be found there between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow.</p></div> </div>
