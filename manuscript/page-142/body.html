<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of two holds, suicide or crime.</p><p>By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes out to throw one&rsquo;s self in the water.</p><p>Excess of reverie breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.</p><p>Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seems strange, and yet it is true. The memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, the more it beams; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon; the star of the inner night. She&mdash;that was Marius&rsquo; whole thought.</p></div> </div>
