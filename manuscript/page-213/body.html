Every day, Jean Valjean put his arm through Cosette&rsquo;s and took her for a walk. He led her to the Luxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her to mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off. As it was a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the poor people surrounded him in church, which had drawn down upon him Th√©nardier&rsquo;s epistle: &ldquo;To the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.&rdquo; He was fond of taking Cosette to visit the poor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet. Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went himself for water to a fountain nearby on the boulevard.</p></div> </div>
