She prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The Th√©nardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream. She remembered that she had gone &ldquo;one day, at night,&rdquo; to fetch water in a forest. She thought that it had been very far from Paris. It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders, and serpents.</p></div> </div>
