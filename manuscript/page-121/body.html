<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am capable of descending the Rue de Grès, of crossing the Place Saint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking the Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the Rue d&rsquo;Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me the Conseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vieilles-Tuileries, of striding across the boulevard, of following the Chaussée du Maine, of passing the barrier, and entering Richefeu&rsquo;s. I am capable of that. My shoes are capable of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much.
