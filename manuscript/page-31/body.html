The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.</p><p>As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste to prepare the shipwreck.</p><p>The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of Statesmen; so that this word, statesmen, has ended by becoming somewhat of a slang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, that wherever there is nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To say &ldquo;the skilful&rdquo; amounts to saying &ldquo;the mediocre.&rdquo;</p><p>In the same way, to say &ldquo;statesmen&rdquo; is sometimes equivalent to saying &ldquo;traitors.&rdquo; If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like the Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature is indispensable. The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, right once firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once assured, attention must be directed to power.</p></div> </div>
