<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>From these two things combined, the public power without, individual happiness within, results social prosperity.</p><p>Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great.</p><p>England solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealth admirably, she divides it badly. This solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes: monstrous opulence, monstrous wretchedness. All enjoyments for some, all privations for the rest, that is to say, for the people; privilege, exception, monopoly, feudalism, born from toil itself. A false and dangerous situation, which sates public power or private misery, which sets the roots of the State in the sufferings of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters.</p></div> </div>
