One of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between.</p><p>They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, and three armorers&rsquo; shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the second in the Rue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. In a few minutes, the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns, nearly all double-barrelled, sixty-four swords, and eighty-three pistols. In order to provide more arms, one man took the gun, the other the bayonet.</p></div> </div>
