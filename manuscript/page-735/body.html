<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marius, petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable, made a sign with his head that he did not.</p><p>The old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him a slap on the knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air, and said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Booby! make her your mistress.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfather had just said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks, the lancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing of all that could bear any reference to Cosette, who was a lily. The good man was wandering in his mind. But this wandering terminated in words which Marius did understand, and which were a mortal insult to Cosette. Those words, &ldquo;make her your mistress,&rdquo; entered the heart of the strict young man like a sword.</p></div> </div>
