I study your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope.&rdquo;</p><p>And Cosette answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, which always turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little pith figures always turn on their peg.</p><p>Cosette&rsquo;s whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency, whiteness, candor, radiance.
