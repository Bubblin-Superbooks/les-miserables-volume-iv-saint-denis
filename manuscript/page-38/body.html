<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory sense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is to say, repose.</p><p>The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on the alert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itself on its guard.</p><p>The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of to-morrow.</p><p>It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.</p><p>What we here call combat may also be designated as progress.</p><p>The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man who should express this word Halt. An Although-Because. A composite individuality, signifying revolution and signifying stability, in other terms, strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future.</p></div> </div>
