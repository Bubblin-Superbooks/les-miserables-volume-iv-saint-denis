It was a boy less than ten years of age, ragged, very small, yellow, with an odd phiz, a vivacious eye, an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain, and wearing a contented air.</p><p>The child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three, addressed himself to Laigle de Meaux.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you Monsieur Bossuet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is my nickname,&rdquo; replied Laigle. &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This.
