<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And then I&rsquo;ll take you to the play. I&rsquo;ll take you to see Frédérick Lemaître. I have tickets, I know some of the actors, I even played in a piece once. There were a lot of us fellers, and we ran under a cloth, and that made the sea. I&rsquo;ll get you an engagement at my theatre. We&rsquo;ll go to see the savages. They ain&rsquo;t real, those savages ain&rsquo;t. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we&rsquo;ll go to the Opera. We&rsquo;ll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well managed. I wouldn&rsquo;t associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the Opera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they&rsquo;re ninnies. They&rsquo;re called dishclouts. And then we&rsquo;ll go to see the guillotine work. I&rsquo;ll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. Monsieur Sanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we&rsquo;ll have famous fun!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
