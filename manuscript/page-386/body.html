<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks, you are lost, you love. But one thing remains for you to do: to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you.</p><p>What love commences can be finished by God alone.</p><p>True love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found, and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely little.</p><p>If you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the sensitive plant; if you are a man, be love.</p></div> </div>
