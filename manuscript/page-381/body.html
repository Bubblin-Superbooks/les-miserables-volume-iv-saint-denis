<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of a single being even to God, that is love.</p><p>Love is the salutation of the angels to the stars.</p><p>How sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!</p><p>What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills the world! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One could comprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father of all evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love.</p><p>The glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams.</p></div> </div>
