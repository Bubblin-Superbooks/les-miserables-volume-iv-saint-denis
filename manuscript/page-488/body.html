I&rsquo;m going to put out the light. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured the elder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. I seem to have feathers under my head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;head,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Gavroche, &ldquo;they say &lsquo;nut&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
