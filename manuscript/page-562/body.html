<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and the unfortunate. In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.</p><p>The real human division is this: the luminous and the shady. To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,&mdash;that is the object. That is why we cry: Education! science! To teach reading, means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.</p><p>However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy. People suffer in the light; excess burns. The flame is the enemy of the wing. To burn without ceasing to fly,&mdash;therein lies the marvel of genius.</p></div> </div>
