<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The Grève having disappeared with the elder branch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name of the Barrière-Saint-Jacques; &ldquo;practical men&rdquo; felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the victories of Casimir Périer, who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe, who represented its liberal sides. Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: &ldquo;What a pity that I was not wounded! Then I might have pardoned!&rdquo; On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry, he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who is one of the most generous figures of our day: &ldquo;His pardon is granted; it only remains for me to obtain it.&rdquo; Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX. and as kindly as Henri IV.</p></div> </div>
