Beloved by Cosette, it was well with him! He asked nothing more! Had any one said to him: &ldquo;Do you want anything better?&rdquo; he would have answered: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; God might have said to him: &ldquo;Do you desire heaven?&rdquo; and he would have replied: &ldquo;I should lose by it.&rdquo;</p><p>Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface, made him shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but he understood instinctively, that it was something terrible.</p><p>He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocent and formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, of his old age, of his misery, of his reprobation.</p></div> </div>
