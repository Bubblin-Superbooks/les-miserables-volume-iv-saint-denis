<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier, was relieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the man with the dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything, except, possibly, the excessive youth and &ldquo;the rustic air&rdquo; of the &ldquo;raw recruit.&rdquo; Two hours afterwards, at four o&rsquo;clock, when they came to relieve the conscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a log near Thénardier&rsquo;s cage. As for Thénardier, he was no longer there. There was a hole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another hole in the roof. One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off, and probably carried away with him, as it was not found. They also seized in his cell a half-empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged. The soldier&rsquo;s bayonet had disappeared.</p></div> </div>
