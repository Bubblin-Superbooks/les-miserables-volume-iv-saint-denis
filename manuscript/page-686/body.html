For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said, outside of life; those words, going away! caused him to re-enter it harshly.</p><p>He found not a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold. She said to him in her turn: &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p><p>He replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not understand what you said.&rdquo;</p><p>She began again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to hold myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen to put in a trunk, that he was obliged to go on a journey, that we were to go away, that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him, and that all is to be ready in a week from now, and that we might go to England.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
