<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, I received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the right arm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland, a thrust from a bayonet, there,&mdash;at the Moskowa seven or eight lance-thrusts, no matter where, at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers. Ah! and then at Waterloo, a ball from a bisca√Øen in the thigh, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How fine that is!&rdquo; exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, &ldquo;to die on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in bed, of an illness, slowly, a bit by bit each day, with drugs, cataplasms, syringes, medicines, I should prefer to receive a cannon-ball in my belly!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
