Commonplace metaphor replies: &ldquo;It is to see thirty-six candles.&rdquo; Here slang intervenes and takes it up: Candle, camoufle. Thereupon, the ordinary tongue gives camouflet as the synonym for soufflet. Thus, by a sort of infiltration from below upwards, with the aid of metaphor, that incalculable, trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the Academy; and Poulailler saying: &ldquo;I light my camoufle,&rdquo; causes Voltaire to write: &ldquo;Langleviel La Beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
