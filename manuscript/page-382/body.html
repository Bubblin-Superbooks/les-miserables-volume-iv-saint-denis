<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>God is behind everything, but everything hides God. Things are black, creatures are opaque. To love a being is to render that being transparent.</p><p>Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever the attitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.</p><p>Parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices, which possess, however, a reality of their own. They are prevented from seeing each other, they cannot write to each other; they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond. They send each other the song of the birds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children, the light of the sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation. And why not? All the works of God are made to serve love. Love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages.</p></div> </div>
