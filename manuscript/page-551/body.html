<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The sugar-manufacturer who says: &ldquo;Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,&rdquo;&mdash;this honest manufacturer talks slang. A certain school of criticism twenty years ago, which used to say: &ldquo;Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,&rdquo;&mdash;talked slang. The poet, and the artist who, with profound understanding, would designate M. de Montmorency as &ldquo;a bourgeois,&rdquo; if he were not a judge of verses and statues, speak slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers &ldquo;Flora,&rdquo; fruits, &ldquo;Pomona,&rdquo; the sea, &ldquo;Neptune,&rdquo; love, &ldquo;fires,&rdquo; beauty, &ldquo;charms,&rdquo; a horse, &ldquo;a courser,&rdquo; the white or tricolored cockade, &ldquo;the rose of Bellona,&rdquo; the three-cornered hat, &ldquo;Mars&rsquo; triangle,&rdquo;&mdash;that classical Academician talks slang.</p></div> </div>
