<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possible catastrophe, instituted a kind of mysterious census.</p><p>All were present at a secret meeting at the Caf√© Musain.</p><p>Enjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical but significant metaphors:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may count. If combatants are required, they must be provided. It can do no harm to have something with which to strike. Passers-by always have more chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there are none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How many of us are there? There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow. Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose. Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared. We must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast.</p></div> </div>
